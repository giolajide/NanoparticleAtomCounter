* Here, we generate atomistic models of supported spherical cap nanoparticles, and compare the results of this atomistic method to that of the np atom counter
* The disadvantage of the atomistic method -- hence the reason for the existence of the np atom counter -- is that it is incredibly slow, especially for larger nanoparticles
